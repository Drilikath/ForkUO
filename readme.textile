Keep in mind that the subversion may not always be stable enough to run as is, this is a working project. Although we will do our best to commit error free code so you can at least compile your own server if you want to do some testing.

In order to compile your own server. You will need to open the project source file *ForkUO.sln* with *Visual Studio*. You then build the entire solution. As the build will fail if you don't allow it to build the Ultima library.
